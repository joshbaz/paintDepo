A clean, dry and solid surface should be obtained after lightly smoothing the blistered and old painted surfaces. For new plastered surfaces, firstly Silkcoat Primer should be applied. Old painted, dirty, damp surfaces, paint dirt, soot and other residues on the surface should be thoroughly cleaned. Silkcoat Primer is applied after the application of SX 2000. After the primer application is dry, the application of silk plaster can be started. The material in the bag is kneaded thoroughly by pouring into approximately 6 liters of water. Depending on climate and application conditions, some more water can be added if necessary. After the prepared material has waited for at least 20 minutes, it is applied to the surface with a plastic trowel by a plaster technique so that it obtains an average thickness of 1 mm. Tools should be cleaned immediately after application. When applied to places where the deformation is excessive; It is advisable to add a glass of water for each pouch of Silkcoat SX 2000 to the material before it is kneaded. The surface should not be left halfway during application. Application can be done with plastic trowel and spray gun. . For new coated surfaces, at least 28 days must be waited for the application of paint to the surface. Ambient and surface temperature should be between + 5ºC and + 35ºC during application and product drying."
