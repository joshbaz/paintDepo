Silkcoat Natural Satin is applied in 2 coats by roller, brush or spray method after being thinned with 10-15% of clean water. Wait at least 2 hours between coats depending on the air temperature. Application tools should be cleaned with water after application. For new coated surfaces, at least 28 days must be waited for the application of paint to the surface. The paint should be mixed until it is completely homogenous before use. Ambient and surface temperature should be between + 5ºC and + 35ºC during application and product drying. If applied on very bright and glassy surfaces, a solid surface should be formed by smoothing the surface first to ensure better adhesion.",
